# Weather-App

## Project Description

> This was made as a side-project for BNHS-Main.

> This project is a weather forecast web application that uses the **WEATHER API** to retrieve weather data of most cities around the world and present it to the user in response to their specific entry.

> It was built to demonstrate the use of **async/await** and **Promises** in javascript to write asynchronous code as well as use **fetch** to retrieve data from an API.

> Done in 3 hours (with less than 250 lines of code) as a challenge.
